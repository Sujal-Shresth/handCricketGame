## Game Description

Hand Cricket is a well-loved game from our childhood, and we've brought it to the digital world. The objective is to score as many runs as possible by playing a simplified version of cricket against the computer. Here's a quick overview of how the game works:

1. **User's Turn:** The user selects a number between 1 and 6 as their move.
2. **Computer's Turn:** The computer generates a random number.
3. **Outcome:** If the numbers match, the user is out, and the computer takes a turn to bat.
4. **Continuation:** The game continues until the user or the computer is out.
5. **Winner:** The winner is determined based on the final score.
