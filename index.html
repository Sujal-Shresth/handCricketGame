                    1 : Extend only your index finger<br>
                    2 : Show 'scissors'<br>
                    3 : Extend your middle, ring, and little fingers<br>
                    4 : Add your index finger to the three fingers<br>
                    5 : Show 'paper'<br>
                    6 : Clench your fist with your thumb extended<br>
                    'Stok': Throw a clenched fist<br>

                    Decide the number of wickets.
                    <br> 
                    Begin with a toss. 
                    <br>
                    The winner of the toss decides who does the batting at first.

                    In batting, both players throw hand signals simultaneously.
                    <br>
                    Calculate the runs based on the numbers thrown.
                    <br>
                    For example, if your friend throws a 6, and you throw a 4, you score 4 runs. If you throw a "stok" and your friend throws a 5, you get 5 runs.
                -->
                <!--
                    If both players throw out the same hand sign, the batter is out. 
                    <br>
                    The bowler gets to bat and at the end, who has the highest runs wins.
